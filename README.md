# cit281-p7
cit281 project-7
<p>Create a GitHub pages website to host our individual CIT 281 portfolios that contain an individual repository for all of our labs and projects throughout the term. Create and style a website hosted on GitHub pages and create a page for every project and lab with links to their respective repositories. I learned how amazing and GitHub pages is, and how valuable it can be to build a great looking portfolio with all of your projects and code.</p>
